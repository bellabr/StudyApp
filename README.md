# StudyApp
An assignment for the course CSC207: Software Design at the University of Toronto.

## Overview
This is a study tool application where users may create, edit, and delete their own study tools--as well as study with an available study tool (public, owned, or invited). 
There are four different user types: admin (the key in `settings/Adminkey.txt` is needed to create this account), temporary (only available for 30 days), trial (only available at this log in), and regular.
Templates have different configurations of which only admins may edit.
A non-admin user can invite other users to edit their study tools, and revoke invitations.
You can view your edit history of your study tool, and revert to any previous edition you like.
Admin users can create or edit templates, change welcome or exit messages, change the admin key, suspend users, and freeze study tools for their moderation.

## Getting Started
Run `Main.java`.
